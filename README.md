# Nucleo-F446RE

Nucleo-F446RE is a 32-bit microcontroller that uses ARM Cortex M-4 processor. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to program the microcontroller is STM32CubeIDE. 
STM32CubeIDE incorporates STM32 configuration and offers multiple features and functionalities for user experience. 
It supports C/C++ language including standard and advanced debugging features. The STM32CubeIDE can be downloaded from the website and the ST-Link Debugger must be downloaded as well in order to load the program into the microcontroller. 
STM32CubeIDE is based on the Eclipse development environment which uses the concept of a workspace that houses all the project files in the computer directory.
